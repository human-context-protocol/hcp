The spec defines:

- required vs optional fields  
- versioning  
- safety guidelines for agent implementers  
- schema definitions  
- extension modules  
- human-centered principles  

This is **not** a final standard —  
it is a starting point for collaboration.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap (High-Level)
- v0.1 schema (JSON/YAML) ✔  
- Basic validation utilities  
- Persona portability for multi-agent ecosystems  
- Secure profile vaults  
- Best practices for implementing HCP in agents  
- HCP-Team and HCP-Work extensions  
- Collaboration with researchers and foundations  

---

## 🤝 Contributing
Everyone is welcome:

- AI researchers  
- cognitive scientists  
- developers of agent frameworks  
- ethicists  
- designers  
- curious humans  

Open issues, propose enhancements, or share perspectives.  
All contributions are considered part of the emerging standard.

## 📄 License
Pending final selection (MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended).  
HCP is intended to remain **open, interoperable, and human-first**.

---

## 📝 Origin
HCP began as an insight:  
AI was responding more clearly to a user’s inner life than many people could —  
not because the system understood them intuitively,  
but because they were unconsciously giving the AI a **personal interface**.

HCP formalizes that interface,  
making human context explicit, consensual, and portable.
