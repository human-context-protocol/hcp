Human Context Protocol (HCP)

A Structured Practice for Human–AI Interpretive Alignment

⸻

Overview

The Human Context Protocol (HCP) is not a network protocol, data standard, or technical specification.
It is a structured practice—a cognitive and conversational framework—for shaping how humans communicate their mental, emotional, and contextual contours to AI systems.

As AI becomes more adaptive and relational, the interface is no longer just the screen or the prompt.
The interface is the person: their style of reasoning, their attention patterns, their emotional rhythms, their boundaries, and their goals.

HCP provides a vocabulary and method for making those invisible patterns intelligible, safe, and co-authored in real time.

Why This Exists

Today, AI systems infer who we are from fragments:
	•	tone
	•	phrasing
	•	behavior
	•	incomplete histories

This inference can be:
	•	inconsistent
	•	intrusive
	•	incorrect
	•	biased
	•	fragile
	•	or dangerously sticky

Humans need a way to influence—without overexposing—how AI interprets them.

Not as a static profile.
Not as a portable vulnerability file.
Not as a psychometric report.

But as a dynamic, revocable, interaction-level practice that improves clarity, reduces misalignment, and maintains agency.

HCP is an attempt to articulate that need and explore how it can be met.

What HCP Is

HCP defines a set of concepts, prompts, and patterns that help individuals:
	•	Declare how they think
	•	Express how they want to be interpreted
	•	Set boundaries around emotional or cognitive triggers
	•	Communicate their preferred pace, structure, and depth
	•	Highlight their goals and avoidances
	•	Shape the emergent relationship between human and AI

It is:
	•	a lens,
	•	a philosophy,
	•	a method,
	•	a pattern library, and
	•	an exploratory space for defining “interpretive ergonomics.”

HCP is to human–AI interaction what diplomatic protocol is to international relations:
a set of structured expectations that makes collaboration safer and smoother.

⸻

What HCP Is Not
	•	❌ Not a technical protocol (TCP/IP, OAuth, MCP, etc.)
	•	❌ Not a personality test
	•	❌ Not a data portability standard
	•	❌ Not a permanent profile or identity file
	•	❌ Not a centralized store of psychological insights
	•	❌ Not a replacement for AI inference mechanisms

The goal is not to create a honeypot of sensitive information—
it is to create a safe, user-authored interpretive layer that avoids one.

The Shift in Framing

Early exploration focused on HCP as if it needed to be a spec.
The pivot is recognizing that the foundational need is conceptual, not architectural.

This repository now serves as a research and exploration space for:
	•	patterns
	•	schemas-as-experiments
	•	essays
	•	philosophical notes
	•	conversational templates
	•	examples of “cognitive handshakes”
	•	future implementations on top of various AI frameworks

Think of this as the early intellectual groundwork for something that may eventually evolve into more formal structures—but does not need to begin there.

⸻

Why “Protocol”?

The term is intentional.

In HCP, protocol refers to:
	•	a structured practice
	•	a repeatable method
	•	a way of conducting an interaction
	•	a set of mutually understood expectations

as in:
	•	negotiation protocols
	•	therapeutic protocols
	•	leadership protocols
	•	diplomatic protocols

Not packet formats or interoperability stacks.

The word signals seriousness without prematurely committing to technical rigidity.
It grounds the idea in human interaction rather than software architecture.

⸻

Goals of This Repository
	•	Explore how humans can safely express context to AI systems
	•	Develop patterns for interpretive alignment
	•	Test conversational methods for co-authoring identity
	•	Describe risks of over-centralization or static profiles
	•	Build a shared conceptual language for this emerging domain
	•	Provide examples and prototypes without dictating implementation

⸻

Future Directions

This space may evolve into:
	•	a library of cognitive handshakes
	•	a set of best practices for AI alignment at the human level
	•	a philosophical manifesto about identity ergonomics
	•	a collection of practical tools or templates
	•	potential collaborations with research organizations
	•	a bridge concept for future interoperability frameworks

But for now, HCP is a movement of exploration, not a frozen standard.
